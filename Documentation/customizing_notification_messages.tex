\section{Customizing notification messages}

\emph{User Data Defence} allows you to customize notification of alerts.

Open settings of \emph{UDDTray}: \emph{Edit-\textgreater{}Preferences},
and select \emph{Alerts} group.

There are some tabs in this group:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Default} - settings for messages, which don't meet any
  condition, if you disable \emph{Show unknown messages}, this messages
  are not shown;
\item
  \emph{Multiple} - settings for notifications, which displayed where
  KNotify is overloaded by \emph{UDDTray} alerts;\\
\item
  \emph{Type filter} - settings for alerts with certain type;
\item
  \emph{Reg Exp Filter} - settings which meet certain Qt regular
  expression.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Format string} field contains message, which was shown in
notification, where \texttt{\%field\%} will be replaced by its value.
There are some system values:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{\%RAW\_MESSAGE\%} will replaced with raw alert text;
\item
  \texttt{\%alerts\_count\%} (only in \emph{Multiple} tab) replaced with
  total count of alerts;
\item
  \texttt{\%max\_level\%} (only in \emph{Multiple} tab) replaced with
  maximum clearance level of received alerts.
\end{itemize}

Now we create custom notifications for \emph{Libre Office} policy (page \pageref{creating_new_policy}).

Go to the \emph{Reg Exp Filter} tab. Enter in \emph{Reg Exp} field
\texttt{type=AVC(.*)libre\_office\_secret} select alert image and
caption, select notification text.

Now if you receive AVC alerts with \texttt{libre\_office\_secret} string
notification system will display something like this:
